# **Key points about SONA 2025 that I found interesting**
#### 1) He talks about the positive things in our country and soemthing abour duty.
#### 2) He says this "My single resounding message to the international business community is this: the Philippines is ready. Invest in the Filipino." He then proceeds to describe Filipino in a positive manner, like he's selling a product.
#### 3) He talks about the "bente pesos na bigas", which was something he promised at the start of his campaign as president.


# **Key points about SONA 2025 that I found weird**
### 1) Footage of Marcos walking, he hasn;t announced anything important yet, so there's no reason to add it. 
### 2) The video showing him greeting everyone, it just made the video longer and didn't provide any useful information.
### 3) The loud music playing throughout the entire video, it didn't provide anything useful about the State Of The Nation.




# **Reflection**
#### The SONA contains some unecessary parts and should have skipped straight to the speech and announcements in order to avoid wasting time. The unnecessary parts are: the loud music, Marcos walking, and all politicians and journalists shown being seated on their seats. The speech starts with him greeting people and saying positive things as if he is trying to reassure people. This is meant to create a positive image of him.

####  The first section  Marcus Jr.'s speech is focused on agriculture and production. He mentions agriculture or agriculture related topics in his speech. He also says positive things about Filipinos and sends a message to the internation business community. This all shows that he wants to improve the economy of the Philippines and promote the country and its workers on the Global Marketplace. 




# **What one word or phrase do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025**
