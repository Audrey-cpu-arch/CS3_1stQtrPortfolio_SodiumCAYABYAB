# **Key points about SONA 2025 that I found interesting**
#### 1) You can determine the font size just by inputting a number of hashtags.
#### 2) You can create tables for data. I found this interesting because unlike the previous programming languages from grade 7-8, Markdown has a specific code on how to make it.
#### 3) You can make block quotes.

### 1) None, because I think all of them are useful and easy.




# **Reflection**
#### Markdown is a programming language that has specific features that the user can control and aren't present in any programming languages in grades 7 and 8: block quotes, lists, tables, footnotes, image, embedding, font style, font size and link embedding. 
#### However, unlike Python or C++, Markdown is unable to execute tasks such as arithmetic operations, loops, functions, and etc. It only shows the output of the user's input in a specific format. The user's code in Markdown determines the format and appearance of the output.
#### This makes Markdown ideal for creating the appearance of a website and organizing data but not for collecting info and doing specific tasks or actions.
