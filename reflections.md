# **Q1 END OF LESSONS REFLECTIONS**


## TOPICS I KNEW WELL
#### 1) Arithmetic operators
###### Arithemtic operators are used in JavaScript to add variables or strings together. When used on strings, it only outputs the strings as it is, unless there are any other commands or errors in the code.
#### 2) For loops
###### A For loop is a control structure used to avoid coding the same code all over again. It has three parts: statement, condition, and increment.
#### 3) While loops
###### A while loop is also a control structure like the For loop with the same purpose: avoid coding the same code all over again. However, unlike the For loop it only uses a condition. The loop keeps on executing the code until the variable no longer fulfills the condition.
#### 4) Arrays
###### Arrays are variables meant to hold multiple values. They use brackets to hold the values.
#### 5) Declaring variables
###### When declaring variables, the variable type is placed before the variable name. The variable name must start with a lowercase letter; numbers, underscores, and uppercase letters aren't allowed at the beginning of variable names. 



## TOPICS THAT NEED FURTHER DISCUSSION AND STUDY
#### 1) button
###### This is because I haven't memorized its syntax. 
#### 2) output
###### I'm still confused how to place the outputs from JavaScript into the HTML website.
#### 3) Math.random()
###### I have just recently learned about this and have yet to master on how to properly use it.
#### 4) do-while statments
###### I forgot how it worked.
#### 5) rli
###### I find it confusing and complex.


## PLAN OF ACTION
###### My plan of action is to review my exercises, reanswer them, then use A.I. to assist me in finding my errors and how to improve my code.


## EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE ACTIVITES IN CLASS
###### ~~I don't remember any of the group activities.~~
